# REPORT REFLECTING ON THE ASSIGNMENT

For this assessment, I divided my tasks into 3 months with the hope to achieve the solution to at least two questions each month, giving myself a December 31st deadline. I expected that if I was able to answer two (2) questions a month, it would provide me enough time to learn every concept I was expected to pick pertaining to these questions, and still avail me with ease to meetup with my regular school schedule and my personal life.

When we were informed that the assessments would be given to us early in September, I was quite happy that we would have enough time to complete it. But when I saw the actual assignment, I was immediately discouraged. It was filled with concepts I was unfamiliar with, and the data-oriented technologies I needed to learn to complete each task was different from the last. But after continually studying the questions, I understood what was expected of me even though I was yet to understand how to achieve it. This gave me the encouragement I needed to begin my assignment, while learning the technologies required.

When cleaning my data, I initially imported the pandas Library as I understood that libraries were easier to work with, but I could not get past questing 1b since I was unsure of how to implement the drop.na syntax in the python code that I required to complete the first task. Further research encouraged me to use a pure python code and I was elated when the syntax finally resulted in the right answer. This was the toughest step in the entire assessment because the minute I was successful with task 1, I knew I could do anything I set my mind to do.

One thing that was great, was the constant guidance provided by our tutor at every point we required it. The workshops were interactive sessions to answer questions and practicalize new concepts and this helped my study even more. Task 3 should have been easier for me since we had a sample from one of the workshops with a different data set and structure, but this took me the longest to decipher. Still, it taught me to think critically, and I learnt to check each chunk of code carefully especially since one misspelled word can stop an entire code from running.
My set timeline was disrupted because some tasks took much longer to figure out than other. Also, I noticed I procrastinated a lot through the whole assignment process, and this caused a lot of delays.

In conclusion, completing these tasks have made me a better programmer. I was unable to meet my personal deadlines but I completed the assessment within the official stipulated timeframe. I learnt how to analyse big-data, cleaning and cropping the data, converting it to CSV format, and then to normalized SQL formats using python codes and all the while maintaining the integrity of the data. I also had the opportunity to practice the construction of SQL queries and I learnt how to forward-engineer data from a MySQL server to a NoSQL database. I think the assessment was perfectly encompassing of all the needed technologies for the course and more required for real life situations. An added advantage for me were the uses of visualization tool such as seaborn and matplotlib, which helped with the graphical representation of my data.

I have learnt that Setting goals can sometimes be vague and unattainable, so I need to set short-term goals to help me achieve my long-term goals. I would define my steps clearly next time and how I hope to achieve this goal. For example, if I hope to complete the first two tasks within the first month, I will create daily tasks and set learning materials to be completed weekly. Also, I will be more time conscious so I can achieve my set goals within the allotted time.
